## Installation

This app is best installed using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs), so that you can easily track and download updates.

Alternatively, you can download the `asx_sensor` directory from inside the `apps` directory here to your local `apps` directory, then add the configuration to enable the `asx_sensor` module.

## How it works

The yfinance module sources the information from Yahoo Finance and makes the information available as sensors in HA.

This information is only daily information, showing the latest close data, and other relevant information about a stock, it does not provide actual trading information.

As this is non time critical sensor, it only gets the information on a set time schedule, once per day at 5.17am before the opening of the market.

### To Run Manually

You will need to create an input_boolean entity to watch for when to update the sensor. When this `input_boolean` is turned on, whether manually or by another automation you create, the scraping process will be run to create/update the sensor.

## AppDaemon Libraries

Please add the following packages to your appdaemon 4 configuration on the supervisor page of the add-on.

```yaml
system_packages: []
python_packages: ["yfinance"]
init_commands: []
```

No specific packages are required for this app.
